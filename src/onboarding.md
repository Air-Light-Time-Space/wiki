# Onboarding

Any current member can onboard a new member to the space.

Make sure that the new member:
* Has filled out a [waiver](waivers.md)
* Has gone through an orietnation and has read and understands the [rules of the space](https://altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/)
* Has made at least one payment of membership dues by cash, check, or paypal

If all of the above is true, you can give them access to the space and [communication channels](#communication-channels) and welcome them to the space! 

## Waivers

Blank waivers can be found in the hanging file just to your left as you walk in the keypad door. Completed waivers can be left in the cash deposit box (on that same wall next to the first aid kit).

## Orientation essentials

Altspace is a special place, and might operate differently from what people are used to.

As well as [written rules](https://altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/), walk the new member through the space.

At a minimum, you should go over these things:

- Exterior door: there's a little jiggle dance you have to do to get it open. Have them try.
- Last person out closes the doors/lock up when you leave. Communicate when you are leaving so anyone else knows they are the last person.
- There is no one responsible for cleaning up your messes except yourself,
  so clean up after yourself + an extra 20%.
- Tag/tape system:
  - red (private - do not use this — There should be a name on it if you have questions.)
  - yellow (use with permission — there should be a name to contact on it.)
  - blue or untagged (public)
- Ask the new member what project(s) they are pursuing so you can give them any specific tool orientations relevant to them,
  or if it's a machine you aren't familiar with, help them to ask in discord.

### Woodshop

 - Dust collection should be connected whenever using the table saw or planer. If there is *any* sawdust accruing in the plastic overflow bag, that means the primary sawdust collection barrel is **over** full and needs to be emptied immediately. Show them how connect the hoses, turn on the machine, and how to remove the sawdust barrel, because it is a little clunky.

### Metalshop

 - Always turn on ventilation.

## Communication channels

💬 [Discord chat
](https://discord.com/channels/834243114339401759/834243243989663744) is where most day to day chatter happens.

✉️ [altspace-seattle
google-group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/altspace-seattle) has existed for a long time, but doesn't get much traffic these days.

✉️ [altspace@ignitionnw.org](mailto:altspace@ignitionnw.org) is a catch-all place to ask questions, monitored by several members, including the space manager.

📆 [ALTSpace public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZnRnc210cjJua2lwZWJpNjN1c2EyamJ2MjBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) is for orientations, events, or anything else you want to coordinate in the space. Contact altspace@ignitionnw.org to get added as a calendar editor (every member should be a calendar editor).

In the past when our shop was smaller, we've used this to coordinate sharing high demand resources like the woodshop. You're welcome to work  without a reservation, but if someone already has it reserved, they get priority. Ensure that your fellow members have fair opportunities to use the space by making your reservations not too frequent or long.
