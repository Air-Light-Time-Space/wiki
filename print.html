<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="electrical"><a class="header" href="#electrical">Electrical</a></h1>
<p>🚨 The building is currently under heavy renovation, so the details here are
likely to change.</p>
<p>Most of the main space and the metal shop are wired into the &quot;High Voltage&quot;
closet in the main space. This door is locked to slow down modifications from
cavalier hackers (apparently this has been an issue in the past). If a circuit
blows, ask around and you can probably find a way in to get it reset.</p>
<p>The woodshop and half of the garage east of the woodshop (Scott's shop) are
inexplicably wired to a breaker that lives way over yonder in the eastern most
garage. Scott's shop also has a new separate dedicated run. Allegedly all the
garages will get their own dedicated circuits run as part of the ongoing
renovation.🤞</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bi-yearly-air-compressor-servicing"><a class="header" href="#bi-yearly-air-compressor-servicing">Bi-yearly Air Compressor Servicing</a></h1>
<p>Several compressed air lines run through the space. The compressor lives under
the stairs in the west alley, accessible from the back door in the main space.</p>
<p>It's good to check the compressor every 6 months or so to make sure it has oil.
There is a reminder to do this on the shared calendar. It's good to take a look
in the compressor room every so often more regularly than that to make sure there
are no problems.</p>
<p>On the east wall of the compressor room there is a grey metal switch box with a 
switch you can use to turn the compressor on and off. Always turn it off before
any kind of servicing. The compressor has a large exposed belt and spinning wheel
and can start suddenly at any time if not disabled. When working on or near the
compressor, put a ziptie or small padlock into the cover of the switch with a note
attached containing your name and contact info. This should help ensure no one
turns the compressor back on while it's in a compromised state.</p>
<p>The compressor room also has a fire extinguisher on the west wall, as well as an
office-style clip light you can reach for in the dark to illuminate the situation.</p>
<p>The large green thing in that room is an air drying unit, use it if you need the
air in the lines to be extra dry, but turn it off when you are done using it. The
tank under the compressor also has a timed discharge port at the back that discharges
any collected condensation on a regular interval (as long as it remains plugged in
and the outlet's protection switch hasn't tripped).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fire-permit-and-extinguishers"><a class="header" href="#fire-permit-and-extinguishers">🔥Fire Permit and Extinguishers🧯</a></h1>
<p>Some of our tools, like welding equipment and the plasma cutter, require us to
have an up to date fire permit - it's a piece of paper hanging in the metal
shop, that must be renewed annually.</p>
<p><img src="images/fire_permit.jpg" alt="fire permit in the metalshop" /></p>
<p>As part of the permitting process, an inspector will stop by unannounced,
usually 1-2 months after the permit is renewed. Among other things, they'll be
verifying that our fire extinguishers have had their annual service. We
typically do them at the same time as the permit, but you can check the tag on
each fire extinguisher in the space to be sure.</p>
<p><img src="images/fire_extinguisher.jpg" alt="fire extinguisher" /></p>
<p>The inspection helps make sure our space is operating safely, and also puts us
on file with the fire department, so that in case there ever <em>is</em> a fire here,
they'll know to respond based on the specific equipment and chemicals we have.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="first-aid-supplies"><a class="header" href="#first-aid-supplies">First Aid Supplies</a></h1>
<p>There is a larger first aid box in the main space with smaller ones in woodshop
and metalshop.</p>
<p>Each should contain (at a minimum):</p>
<ul>
<li>disposable sanitary gloves</li>
<li>antiseptic wipes</li>
<li>various sizes of bandaids</li>
<li>antibiotic ointment</li>
<li>ziplock bag and chemical cold pack in case of amputation 😬</li>
<li>disposable splinter picker</li>
<li>knuckle bandages</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally the larger box in the main space should have: </p>
<ul>
<li>NSAID like acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen</li>
<li>eye-wash</li>
<li>medical tape and gauze for when band-aids won't suffice</li>
<li>butterfly/wound clamping bandages: e.g. 3M Steri Strip Skin Closures 1/4&quot; X 3&quot;</li>
</ul>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="onboarding"><a class="header" href="#onboarding">Onboarding</a></h1>
<p>Any current member can onboard a new member to the space.</p>
<p>Make sure that the new member:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has filled out a waiver</li>
<li>Has read and understands the <a href="https://altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/">rules of the space</a></li>
<li>Has made at least one payment of membership dues by cash, check, or paypal</li>
</ul>
<p>If all of the above is true, you can tell them the codes and welcome them to the space! Have them send an email to the space manager to get an invitation to the mailing list.</p>
<p>Blank waivers can be found in the black filing cabinet near the side-walkway door in the main space. Completed waivers can be left in the cash deposit box (on that same wall above the first aid kit).</p>
